The goal of project is to be able to input datasets into the functions to provide niceley outputted format to go onto statistical reports. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of project like so:

``` r
#First install devtool
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)

#Then install from github URL
install_github("")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
##install devtools first

## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
